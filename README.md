# Pricing-Used-Car-With-ML
Build ML models to predict the price of used cars.

This project is a part of the data scientist professional certification challenge from DataCamp, along with a non-techical presentation and several other coding challenges 


Note: gridsearch was actually broken down into multiple small grids, iterating 2 params at a time except for learning_rate, to meet the short deadline and computing power access
